            <h1><span class="name">Sheldon Cooper's </span> World</h1>
            <h2>"I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested."</h2>
            <small>Sheldon Lee Cooper</small>

            <p>Originally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving his first Ph.D. at the
                age of
                16. As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a "wunderkind", such as his plan to
                provide
                free electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan stopped by government pen
                pushers
                claiming it's illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly geeky, he has no qualms
                about
                speaking Klingon, wearing vintage t-shirts sporting superhero logos, or spouting various historical and
                cultural anecdotes (e.g., his account of the introduction of the fork into Thailand). While he might
                claim
                to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have his faults. Sheldon is characterized by a strict
                adherence to routine and hygiene; an overly intellectual personality; a tenuous understanding of irony,
                sarcasm and humor; and a general lack of humility or empathy, the former of which is demonstrated in the
                fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his admiration for his superior intellect

            <h3>Sheldon and science </h3>
            <p>Sheldon's work on string theory is concentrated in several different directions. Notably, Sheldon has
                refocused his research from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory. He wrote a paper on the
                decays of highly excited massive string states and illustrated mirror symmetry in the footnote of a
                publication. He determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and
                gauge bosons and reconciled the black hole information paradox with his theory of string-network
                condensates following a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate. He
                also designated time for solving the space-time geometry in higher spin gravity and worked on
                time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de
                Sitter space.</p>
